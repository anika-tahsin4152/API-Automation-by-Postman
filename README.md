# API Automation by Postman

## About Project:
## I've delineated several pivotal test scenarios in my evaluation of the Dmoney REST API. Firstly, I aim to gauge the administrative functionalities, scrutinizing the admin's proficiency in establishing an agent and two customers using specific login credentials (admin@roadtocareer.net and 1234). Subsequently, my focus shifts towards financial operations, primarily assessing the API's competence in orchestrating deposits from the SYSTEM account to the agent's account, confined within the range of 10 tk to 10,000 tk. Furthermore, I delve into agent and customer interactions, including the agent's ability to initiate deposits to customers, verify their own balance, and oversee customer transactions such as withdrawals, balance inquiries, peer-to-peer transfers, and payments to a designated merchant. To conclude, I'd like to make sure that both the second customer and the merchant have the means to quickly review their respective account balances. These meticulously structured scenarios provide a comprehensive evaluation of the Dmoney REST API, covering fundamental financial processes.
